# Hacker Typer
A simple script I wrote on the bus ride back from MHacks at 4:00 in the morning.
Run this script on a file, and start mashing on your keyboard. The file's
contents will magically type out on the screen with every keystroke! Hack the
planet!

## Dependencies
You need Python's ncurses library. And Python.

## Usage

    $ hacker.py super_computer_virus.c
